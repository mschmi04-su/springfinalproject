Five years later, while investigating a CIA blacksite in <a href=\"/singapore/3035-1881/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1881\">Singapore</a>, the protagonist (along with both Hendricks and CIA agent Rachel Kane) uncover the defection of an elite team of WA cyborgs (led by Commander John Taylor). An bonus non-canon version of the campaign, known as \"Nightmares\", features the same locales in a new story involving a <a href=\"/undead-invasion/3015-3261/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3261\">zombie outbreak</a>.</p><p>Both Multiplayer and Zombies modes make a return, each with new enhancements. Multiplayer builds upon its predecessor with advanced mobility options based on Advanced Warfare (including <a href=\"/wall-run/3015-748/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-748\">wall-running</a>, <a href=\"/knee-sliding/3015-5921/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5921\">power-sliding</a>, and <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">boost-jumping</a>). Along with the standard \"Pick 10\" customization system, the game introduces player characters (known as Specialists, each with their own Power Weapon or Special Ability that can be used in short amounts) and customizable weapon appearances. Zombies features both an <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">XP</a> progression system and a new story (known as \"Shadows of Evil\") set in a twisted zombie-infested 1940\\'s city as a new group of troubled individuals are led by the mysterious Shadow Man.</p><p>Both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports are done in conjunction with <a href=\"/beenox-studios/3010-5259/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5259\">Beenox</a> and <a href=\"/mercenary-technology/3010-9294/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-9294\">Mercenary Technology</a> and are missing some key features, most notably the entire Campaign mode, customizable weapon appearances, and <a href=\"/esports/3015-4796/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4796\">eSports</a> tools. To make up for that, these ports include <a href=\"/call-of-duty-black-ops/3030-26423/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26423\">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> as a downloadable bonus. It is the last Call of Duty game to be released on those systems.</p><h2>Campaign Missions</h2><ul><li>1. Black Ops</li><li>2. New World</li><li>3. In Darkness</li><li>4. Provocation</li><li>5.

Under the new system, once <a href=\"/shield-regeneration/3015-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2349\">shields</a> have been depleted, the player can only take a few hits until death, but once shields recharge, health resets. This is explained through the new Mark VI suit, which injects bio-foam directly into the wearer\\'s wounds. <a href=\"/stealth-camouflage/3055-846/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">Active Camo</a> has been removed as an item. Instead, the Arbiter has a rechargeable version of Camo, instead of a <a href=\"/flashlight/3055-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlight</a> like the Chief. Another new addition is <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual wielding</a> certain weapons, including the <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol</a>, the new <a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">SMG</a>, the <a href=\"/needler/3055-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\">needler</a>, the <a href=\"/plasma-pistol/3055-119/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-119\">plasma pistol</a>, and the <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">plasma rifle</a>. When dual wielding, weapons take longer to reload and the ability to throw <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenades</a> is taken out. Another newly added mechanic is the ability to board enemy vehicles when they are near the player and travelling at low speeds.</p><p>The most noticeable change in the weapons is the absence of the iconic <a href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">assault rifle</a>. It is replaced by the new <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">battle rifle</a>; a three shot burst weapon with a 2x scope. The Covenant equivalent of the battle rifle is the <a href=\"/covenant-carbine/3055-137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-137\">carbine</a>; a semi-automatic weapon that also has a 2x scope (the carbine uses <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammo</a> instead of battery power). In addition to the battle rifle and carbine, there is now the SMG (a small compact fully automatic weapon), a new pistol with no scope, the <a href=\"/brute-shot/3055-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-123\">brute shot</a> (Covenant <a href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-252\">grenade launcher</a>), a <a href=\"/brute-plasma-rifle/3055-1105/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1105\">brute plasma rifle</a> (which fires faster than the regular plasma rifle), an improved <a href=\"/m41-rocket-launcher/3055-134/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-134\">rocket launcher</a> (which locks onto enemy vehicles), and the <a href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">energy sword</a> (which can now be used by the player).</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Compared to Halo: Combat Evolved, there have been some noticeable changes in the arsenals of both Human and Covenant forces. The <a href=\"/ma5b-assault-rifle/3055-5594/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5594\">MA5-series Assault Rifle</a> has been absent, replaced by both the <a href=\"/m7-smg/3055-126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-126\">M7 Submachine Gun</a> and <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">BR55 Battle Rifle</a>. The <a href=\"/m6d-pistol/3055-2806/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2806\">M6D Magnum</a> has also been replaced by the weaker M6C Magnum. The Covenant now have new tools in their disposal: the semi-automatic Covenant Carbine, the long-ranged Particle Beam Rifle, the Brute Plasma Rifle, and the explosive Brute Shot. Players can now carry the Fuel Rod Gun and Energy Sword into combat, as well as equip the mysterious Sentinel Beam.</p><h4>Human Weapons</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/m6c-magnum/3055-2807/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2807\"><b>Magnum</b></a> - A semi-automatic <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">handgun</a> useful for short-to-medium ranged combat.

Very accurate and has barely any recoil. Each clip contains 36 rounds (12 bursts) and players can carry up to 108 rounds (36 bursts). Useful for medium-to-long ranged combat.

The game had many advanced features including <a href=\"/matchmaking/3015-3334/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3334\">matchmaking</a>, <a href=\"/voice-chat/3015-648/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-648\">voice chat</a>, and <a href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">rankings</a>. There was also some customization implemented into the game as well, which created a lot of <a href=\"/user-generated-content/3015-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-129\">user created content</a>. Many games came out of these customization options, such as Tremors, Troy, Vehicle Wars and the most popular being <a href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">Zombies</a> which grew so popular Bungie saw fit to put it into Halo 3. Players really enjoyed the customization options and kept many players sticking around even after getting their fill of matchmaking. The match making games were very competitive in Halo 2 due to the intensive ranking system. The way the ranking system in Halo 2 works is when the player first starts playing the game they start at level 1 and as they win matches their level increases. If they lose enough matches they can drop levels. These ranking were taken very seriously by the Halo 2 community. The color of the level a player had was very important to most Halo 2 fanatics. They can see what the levels look like in the picture below.</p><p>Levels 44-50 were \"secret\" levels -- they were picture of various things, such as the moon or the halo ring.</p><p>Halo 2 had 24 maps the people could play online and was the most played game ever on Xbox Live. Even after the Xbox 360 was released Halo 2 still remained the most popular. The first game to top the amount of online players Halo 2 had each month, was the original <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a>.</p><h3>Clans</h3><p>Halo 2 is one of the few Xbox games (and is the only game in the series) to support a dedicated in-game <a href=\"/clan/3015-643/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-643\">\"clan\"</a> system, where players can form named groups outside of the \"friends list\" system both to find games easier and to combat other Clans. Clans have a 100-member limit and must be invited by qualified Clan members.</p><p>There are four types of clanmates, each with their own hierarchy and privileges: <strong>Overlords</strong>, <strong>Staff</strong>, <strong>Members</strong>, and <strong>Peons</strong>. All clanmates can participate in Clan matches and can invite other players to join the Clan (with the exception of Peons). Overlords and Staff can promote/demote Members and Peons, as well as boot them from the clan. Overlords can do the same thing with Staff.</p><h3>Matchmaking Playlists</h3><ul><li>Rumble Pit</li><li>Double Team</li><li>Team Slayer</li><li>Team Skirmish</li><li>Team Training</li><li>Team Snipers</li><li>Team Hardcore</li><li>Big Team Battle</li><li>Team SWAT</li><li>H2 Challenge</li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-549346\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-549346\"><img alt=\"Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.</figcaption></figure><p>The Xbox version of Halo 2 included 12 multiplayer maps, two of which are remakes from <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>.

As players began to practice these glitches and become well-versed in executing them they gained a much more significant place in the <a href=\"/meta-game/3015-905/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-905\">meta-game</a>, with some of the weapon-based glitches becoming essential for success against the higher ranking players. While game creator Bungie officially decreed on several occasions that a player\\'s use of glitches for personal gain, in a Matchmaking setting, was a form of cheating, the developer had no way of tracking the use of such glitches by players. Ultimately, there were no widespread punishments or repercussions handed-down to players who utilized these glitches.</p><p>Some of the most noteworthy glitches:</p><h3><a href=\"/bxr/3015-2751/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2751\"><b>BXR</b></a></h3><p>Commonly used in conjunction with the <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">Battle Rifle</a> (though possible to execute with any reloadable weapon) the BXR was a weapon animation glitch that allowed for a nearly instantaneous close-ranged kill. The glitch became very widespread among the highest ranks of players as the meta-game progressed.</p><h3>Quick Reload (YY)</h3><p>Another glitch commonly used among higher-caliber players, the Quick Reload glitch was a weapon animation glitch that shaved precious seconds off of a player\\'s reload time, allowing them to fire their weapon again sooner than they normally would with the default reload. The glitch was only possible when a player was carrying a secondary weapon. The move was executed by the player pressing the Y button twice in quick succession as soon as the reload animation reached the point where the in-game character began to insert a new clip into the weapon. If done properly the player will quickly switch to their secondary weapon and then back to their primary, eliminating the rest of the reload animation while still giving the player a full clip.</p><h3>Double Melee (BXB)</h3><p>A third weapon animation glitch, the BXB was used to give players a significant advantage in close-range combat. Executed by pressing B, X, B in quick succession (under the default controller settings), the glitch allowed players to melee twice in a much shorter time span than if they were simply to press the melee button two times. Contrary to the BXR, which required a full clip of ammo to execute properly, the BXB required the player to have a partially depleted or empty ammo clip in their primary weapon. As with the other weapon glitches, the BXB saw very widespread use among the top-tier players.</p><h3>Double Shot (RRX)</h3><p>One of the most popular glitches among <a href=\"/major-league-gaming/3015-1858/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1858\">MLG</a> fans and players, the Double Shot was a glitch that was used primarily with the Battle Rifle that allowed players to fire two of the weapon\\'s 3-shot bursts in one shot, resulting in 6 bullets being fired at once. The downside to this glitch was that after successfully firing a Double Shot, there was a significant span of time (roughly two to three seconds) where the player could not fire their weapon, and could only attack if they threw a grenade, used a melee attack, or switched to a secondary weapon. For this reason players would often hold off on using a Double Shot unless they were one or several \"shots down\" in a BR fight, or had a secondary weapon that they could \"YY\" with to cancel the long delay after a successful double shot.</p><h3>Quad Shot (RRXYYRRX)</h3><p>Similar to the double shot the quad shot, if done right, can shoot 4 shots out of the BR in half the time it normally would take. To do this the player need two weapons, first they start out with their double shot then they press \"YY\" really fast in order to cancel the reload; if they double shot correctly they will notice the reload animation isn\\'t playing but it is still reloading in the background (this is normal so don\\'t worry), now after pressing \"YY\" do another double shot, and with much practice the player can do <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCEZz1zS3aQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"/super-bouncing/3015-401/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-401\">Super Bouncing</a> (also known as Super Jumping)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7421875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\"><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"></noscript></a><figcaption>A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.</figcaption></figure><p>A glitch in the game\\'s <a href=\"/havok-physics/3015-502/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok</a> physics engine that makes it possible for players to \"bounce\" to extreme heights, enabling them to reach previously inaccessible and out-of-bounds regions on a multiplayer map. The glitch was used quite frequently in a Matchmaking setting to give a player or team a significant advantage through an unreachable hiding spot or unfair vantage point.</p><h3>Sword Canceling (Butterflying)</h3><p>Sword canceling is a glitch that takes advantage of the \"lunge\" effect that the Energy Sword provides for the player. By aiming at an opponent with the Energy Sword at a close enough proximity for the reticule to light up red, then pressing the Right Trigger and X in quick succession, a player can achieve the normal Sword lunge without in any way damaging their opponent. The glitch is most commonly used to give players a means of reaching previously inaccessible ledges or areas of a map. The glitch earned the nickname \"Butterflying\" due to the strange, butterfly-like motion of the character model\\'s arms when performing the sword cancel.</p><h3>Rocket Sword Glitch</h3><p>A glitch that would require a sword and a rocket launcher as a secondary. The player would look at an enemy from a distance and rapidly alternate pressing \"Y\" and \"B\" and they would launch towards the person they were aiming at from afar.</p><h2>Cheating</h2><p>As with most online games, Halo 2\\'s online environment featured some players who manipulated and modified certain aspects of the game to provide themselves with an unfair advantage over their opponents. Players cheated most commonly in matchmaking playlists, so that they could more easily obtain a matchmaking rank that players would see associated with their gamertag. The highest-level matchmaking ranks, that featured symbols in place of numbers (ranks 44-50), were the most desirable and most sought after ranks to cheaters; therefore, non-cheaters often found it very difficult to play a legitimate, cheat-free match at the highest ranks. There were several different methods of cheating, each with different effects on gameplay.</p><h3>Modding</h3><p>Achieved through the use of cheat-devices such as Action Replay, Modding was the most common, game-changing form of cheating. \"Modders\" manipulated map files and gametypes to create gameplay that was well-outside the normal limits placed by the game engine. Common modded elements were changes in player speed and gravity, changed weapon properties (such as <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">Plasma Rifles</a> that fired <a href=\"/wraith/3055-531/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-531\">Wraith</a> projectiles), and changed vehicle properties (flying <a href=\"/m12-warthog/3055-193/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-193\">Warthogs</a>, flying turrets, faster <a href=\"/scorpion/3055-760/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-760\">Scorpions</a>, etc.). Due to the dramatic, game-changing effects of modding, it was fairly easy for Bungie\\'s automated banning tool -- notoriously dubbed the \"Banhammer\" by players and Bungie staff -- to detect and ban players who used modded files in matchmade games. Most \"modders\" had only a few hours, at most, to rise through the matchmaking ranks before being faced with a permanent ban, and a vast majority of modders were inevitably banned. The problem was that there were so many free two-month Xbox Live trials available, it was easy for a modder to quickly make another account.</p><h3>Standbying</h3><p>The second most game-changing form of cheating, behind Modding, was known as Standbying. Making use of the game\\'s host-based server system, standbying was achieved by having the \"host\" player manipulate their internet connection to cause problems for the other players in the match. When the host managed to successfully tamper with their connection, it would cause all of the other players in the game to experience enormous amounts of lag. The host\\'s Xbox was immune to the lag issues, and could travel around the map killing enemy players or completing game objectives without much, if any, opposition. Though the Standby glitch was originally achieved by players manually pressing the \"Standby\" button on their router, modem, or switch, eventually players used various computer software so that they could throttle the connections of only the opposing team, giving all of their teammates a reprieve from the negative effects of the glitch. Eventually, Bungie improved the banhammer to better detect and control \"standbyers\" in matchmaking.</p><h3>Bridging</h3><p>Bridging was a method of controlling \"host\" in a matchmaking game, and, more specifically, a way of ensuring that a certain player in the game always received host. Unlike modding and standbying, though, bridging was not a very detrimental form of cheating on its own. Bridging was accomplished through the use of specific Firewall software that controlled the ports and incoming IP Addresses for a player\\'s router or switch. By using the program with the correct settings, a player could be ensured of being host for every game they played. Also, due to the nature of the glitch, bridgers could not be matched with or against other bridgers, so the bridging player always decided who received host. While Bridging was used in conjunction with Standbying or Modding to ensure that those forms of cheating worked as efficiently as possible by giving a certain player host, it was also used as a preventative measure against cheaters. Some players used bridging to make sure that no nefarious players could obtain host, therefore ensuring a quality match experience. As of the 1.6 update for Halo 2, the most common methods of Bridging were no longer effective or possible in matchmaking.</p><h2><b>Soundtrack</b></h2><p>The Halo 2 Original Soundtrack was released in two volumes, composed by <a href=\"/martin-odonnell/3040-1741/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1741\">Martin O\\'Donnel</a> and <a href=\"/michael-salvatori/3040-1742/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1742\">Michael Salvatori</a>.

It differs from most others at the time in the damage system, where it has the standard health bar with eight bars which decrease when hit after the shields have failed (can be replenished with health packs). As opposed to picking up an \"armor power up\" the player always has shields which slowly take damage when hit like a secondary health bar, if hit enough they fail and health begins to decrease, and if the player keeps their head down long enough they recharge. Halo made this style of health regeneration popular within many games made today, and this reason is one of many of why Halo was so revolutionary. Along with popularizing health regeneration Halo also popularized restricting the player to only carrying two weapons at a time, simultaneously solving the problem of cycling through large numbers of weapons on a console pad and forcing developers to make every weapon \"count\", as the pistol could no longer be a near-useless weapon of last resort, for example.</p><p>Power ups include over-shields, health packs, and active camo (invisibility).</p><h3>Weapons</h3><h4>Human Weapons</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/m6d-pistol/3055-2806/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2806\"><strong>Pistol</strong></a> - A semi-automatic slow-firing <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">handgun</a> noted for its powerful <a href=\"/magnum/3055-1823/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1823\">magnum</a> ammunition and high accuracy for close-to-medium ranges (with a 2x magnification \"smart scope\" that relays data directly to the user\\'s HUD).

Unlike other arena multiplayer games at the time, no <a href=\"/bots/3015-597/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-597\">bots</a> are supported.</p><p>While the PC and Mac ports of the game removed split-screen multiplayer support, they added support for <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online multiplayer</a> for up to 16 players through GameSpy. Shortly before the demise of GameSpy\\'s service in May 2014, Bungie released an official patch to keep the server list functionality online.</p><h3>Maps</h3><p>The base game included 13 maps of varying sizes, only two of which support vehicles.

Humans, under the United Nations Space Command ( <a href=\"/unsc/3015-3859/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">UNSC</a>) have harnessed faster-than-light \"Slipspace\" travel and have colonized hundreds of planets in solar systems across the galaxy. During the Human expansion, they encounter an alliance of alien species, called <a href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">the Covenant</a>, who are inexplicably intent on the complete eradication of Humankind from the galaxy. Fortunately, the UNSC had previously created a <a href=\"/super-soldier/3015-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-90\">supersoldier</a> program to deal with terrorists, labelling the genetically-modified subjects \" <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">Spartans</a>,\" and equipping the super soldiers with a suit of power armour made of the most cutting edge technology available, that was soon made even more formidable with the addition of <a href=\"/energy-force-shield/3055-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-644\">energy shields</a> based on stolen Covenant technology.</p><p>In August of 2552, the Covenant find the planet <a href=\"/reach/3035-571/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-571\">Reach</a>, a major Human military stronghold, the second-most well protected planet after Earth herself, and assault the planet with a massive fleet. Reach falls, and most of the Spartans are lost in the battle. One, however, Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, commonly known as simply \" <a href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-175\">the Master Chief</a>,\" escapes aboard the UNSC <a href=\"/pillar-of-autumn/3055-1835/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1835\">Pillar of Autumn</a>, a Halcyon-class battlecruiser, that flees into Slipspace away from Reach at a supposedly random vector. The Pillar of Autumn falls out of Slipspace several weeks later in an unknown quadrant of space, unable to contact any other UNSC forces. There, they find a massive artificial installation, shaped like a perfectly round ring, orbiting a gas giant. <a href=\"/cortana/3005-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-315\">Cortana</a>, the ship\\'s onboard AI, notes to Captain <a href=\"/jacob-keyes/3005-1580/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1580\">Jacob Keyes</a> that the ring\\'s inner concave features a terraformed landscape similar to most terrestrial planets, and even has atmosphere and gravity levels comparable to that of Earth.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345405\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345405\"><img alt=\"The Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 1600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 1600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Pillar of Autumn</figcaption></figure><p>Within moments of exiting Slipspace and finding the ring, the Pillar of Autumn is located by a Covenant starship, which was already in the vicinity of the ringworld when they arrived. The Covenant, however, withhold bombarding the Autumn with plasma weapons so close to the ring, and instead deploy infantry to board the cruiser. Just before the Covenant\\'s arrival on-board, the Master Chief is awakened from cryo-sleep, from which he makes his way to the bridge, where Captain Keyes gives him his pistol. Keyes\\'s plan is to crash-land the Autumn on the habitable ringworld. Before leaving, the Master Chief takes the chip that contains Cortana and inserts the chip into his MJOLNIR suit in order to prevent her from falling into Covenant hands. Together, the Master Chief and Cortana make their way through the quickly-deteriorating Autumn, toward the ship\\'s escape pods, where the remaining marines on-board have prepared for evacuation. The Master Chief enters a escape pod, and it jettisons from the Pillar of Autumn as the cruiser careens into the atmosphere of the ring.</p><h3>Halo / Truth and Reconciliation / The Silent Cartographer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\"><img alt=\"Halo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo</figcaption></figure><p>The Master Chief\\'s escape pod crash-lands onto the ring, killing all the marines within and knocking the Master Chief unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the Master Chief learns that other pods have landed safely within the vicinity and Cortana intercepts Covenant chatter revealing that the Covenant have seized the wreckage of the Autumn and have captured Captain Keyes himself, holding him prisoner aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Collecting what is left of the UNSC Marines, the Master Chief, <a href=\"/sergeant-major-avery-junior-johnson/3005-964/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-964\">Sergeant Avery Johnson</a>, and dropship pilot Carol Rawley (known in-game by her callsign \"Foe Hammer\") make a push for the Truth and Reconciliation, where they plan to rescue Keyes from capture. Upon meeting up with him again, Captain Keyes reveals that he has learned through eavesdropping on his captor\\'s conversations that the Covenant call the ringworld \" <a href=\"/halo/3035-58/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-58\">Halo</a>,\" and that they deem it not only as a religious relic, but as a powerful superweapon, one with enough influence to give its manipulator the power to control the galaxy. Cortana remarks she had intercepted several transmissions referring to a \"control room,\" and that she assumed the Covenant were looking for a control room to a cruiser damaged in the battle above the ring. Instead, the Covenant are actually looking for Halo\\'s control center. Cortana believes that the Humans can get there first if she can interface with a local mapping station referred to by the Covenant as the \"Silent Cartographer\".</p><p>Committed to stopping the Covenant before they find the Control Room, and reinvigorated after the successful invasion of the Truth and Reconciliation, the marines on Halo begin a large-scale assault for the Silent Cartographer. In the meantime, Keyes gains information regarding the location of a large Covenant weapons cache. Believing he and a group of marines led by Sergeant Johnson can seize the cache, he leaves to make his way there, without the Master Chief, who is sent to find and operate the Silent Cartographer. The Chief is successful in this mission, and learns the location of the Control Room, as Keyes and Johnson close in on the weapons cache, deep inside a dense jungle several hundred miles away from the Cartographer island.</p><h3>Assault on the Control Room / 343 Guilty Spark</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\"><img alt=\"Assault on the Control Room\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Assault on the Control Room\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Assault on the Control Room</figcaption></figure><p>Foe Hammer brings the Master Chief and Cortana as close as she can to the Control Room, where the Master Chief makes a push through heavy Covenant resistance--the heaviest yet seen on Halo--for the Control Room, which is a vast chamber with a holographic Halo rotating around the perimeter and central platform. Upon reaching the Control Room (and locking the Covenant out of it), the Master Chief removes Cortana\\'s chip and uploads her into the terminal. She exclaims that the wealth of information is nearly intoxicating, even for an AI like herself, and mentions that an ancient alien race called the <a href=\"/the-forerunner/3015-80/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunners</a> built an array of Halos just like this one, millions of years ago. And as she uncovers this information, she stops abruptly. Horrified by something unknown to the Master Chief, she orders him to find Keyes and to stop him from opening the weapons cache \"before it is too late.\"</p><p>Leaving Cortana in the locked Control Room, the Master Chief and Foe Hammer hurry for the jungle. Once in the jungle, beneath the fog and foliage canopy, the Chief finds corpses of Covenant soldiers-- <a href=\"/grunts/3015-1331/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1331\">Grunts</a>, <a href=\"/jackals/3015-3379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3379\">Jackals</a>, and even <a href=\"/elites/3015-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites</a>--and an abandoned <a href=\"/pelican/3055-1038/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1038\">Pelican</a> dropship playing a looping distress message. Traversing the jungle, the Master Chief finds a facility nestled into the side of a bluff--the cache Keyes came to find. Inside the facility, the Chief finds little trace of Captain Keyes, Johnson, or the marines amongst the scattered and panicked Covenant troops and Covenant corpses, but finds massive amounts of alien blood splattering the walls, far more than would be created by being shot by Human weapons. Later, he comes across a single marine who appears to have lost his mind, shooting at anything that moves and telling \"those things\" to stay away from him, and that he won\\'t let them get him. Deep within the facility, the Master Chief finds a heavy blast door locked from the outside by a UNSC tech-lock. Activating it, the Master Chief opens the door and finds a marine corpse slumped against the door. Another marine\\'s helmet lies nearby on the ground, next to a large pool of blood. The Master Chief links up with the video feed from the missing marine\\'s helmet, which shows Keyes and Johnson investigating the cache before being ambushed by a new, unidentified non-Covenant alien species. The video feed shows Keyes\\'s group completely overrun by the pulpy creatures before the video ends abruptly, citing the marine\\'s death as the cause for disruption.</p><p>Moments after viewing the feed, the Master Chief is ambushed by a massive swarm of the small, pulpy aliens, now accompanied by larger Combat Forms. The Combat Forms resemble--and, indeed, are--rotting Covenant and Human corpses, now under the control of the smaller Infection Forms. Fighting his way out to the jungle, killing both former enemies and allies now controlled by the parasite, the Master Chief exits the facility on the far side of the bluff, and is assisted by a number of airborne robots of unknown origin, armed with powerful laser weaponry that seems to be perfectly designed to destroy the mutated creatures. The leader of the robots (which are known as Sentinels) teleports the Master Chief to a raised position atop a gigantic tower, and introduces himself as <a href=\"/343-guilty-spark/3005-1190/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1190\">343 Guilty Spark</a>, the Monitor of Installation Zero-Four (the Forerunner term for this specific Halo, as there are seven total). Spark exclaims that someone--the Covenant, who he calls an impatient and overzealous group of aliens--has released <a href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">the Flood</a>, the parasitic lifeform now rampant upon the soil of Halo. Calling the Master Chief a \"Reclaimer,\" the Monitor states the only way to stop the Flood is to activate Halo itself, a task for which they require the Index, a Forerunner tech-key located within a tower called the Library.</p><h3>The Library / Two Betrayals</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\"><img alt=\"Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"The Library\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"The Library\"</figcaption></figure><p>The Monitor escorts the Master Chief through myriad waves of Flood Combat Forms, commenting that that the Chief\\'s weapons are highly ineffective against the Flood, and makes several comments regarding the Master Chief\\'s lack of preparedness for Flood containment protocols. On the way, Guilty Spark mentions that the Flood are contained on Halo for study, and that, in the case that the Flood escape Halo, they would consume all sentient life in the galaxy. Once at the Index, the Monitor absorbs the key\\'s data, and teleports both himself and the Master Chief back to the Control Room.</p><p>When the pair arrive at Halo\\'s Control Room, Cortana reappears in the terminal just as the Master Chief inserts the Index to activate the ring\\'s weaponry. She impedes the process and uses her command of the ringworld\\'s systems to temporarily disable the Monitor. Cortana derides the Master Chief for falling in step with Spark without knowing the full capability of Halo\\'s power. \"Halo doesn\\'t kill the Flood,\" Cortana explains, \"it kills their food. Human, Covenant, whatever. We\\'re all equally edible.\"</p><p>The Chief questions the Monitor, who seems strangely confused that the Master Chief was ignorant to this knowledge--as though he should have known this before. When Cortana absorbs the Index\\'s data and is reinserted into the MJOLNIR armor, the Monitor summons a squad of Sentinels to attack the Master Chief, who now fights a war on three fronts--Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels. Cortana and the Master Chief escape, and Cortana--having completely assimilated the vast breadth of Halo\\'s information--tells the Master Chief that the only way to guarantee Halo cannot be fired, which would trigger the rest of the rings in the array and thus destroy all sentient life in the galaxy, is to destroy it entirely, and that the only way to destroy Halo is to detonate the fusion core inside the wreckage of the Pillar of Autumn, and that the only way to detonate the Autumn\\'s core is with a special set of passcodes contained in a chip implanted in the brain of Captain Keyes. Therefore, he must be rescued at all costs.</p><p>The Master Chief destroys the three generators powering the majority of Halo\\'s central functions, buying enough time for Cortana to find Keyes before the Monitor can reboot the ring\\'s arsenal. With that done, she determines that Keyes--alive or dead--is on-board the now Flood-controlled Truth and Reconciliation.</p><h3>Keyes / The Maw</h3><p>Cortana manages to transport them to the Truth and Reconciliation via a teleportation tactic similar to that which the Monitor uses. Immediately, Keyes, sounding pained and on the verge of death, radios the Master Chief to turn back, to leave Halo by any means possible. The Flood, having completely overrun the ship, gather piles of Covenant corpses in the two largest rooms for some unknown purpose (later entries in the series imply that this was in preparation for the construction of a <a href=\"/gravemind/3005-996/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-996\">Gravemind</a>). And as the Chief makes his way toward Keyes, he learns that the Flood are repairing the Truth and Reconciliation, planning to leave Halo in order to consume more sentient life. The Chief finds Keyes, but finds him too late. Keyes is totally consumed by the Flood and has been absorbed into a large, fleshy growth of Flood tissue. Cortana remarks that Keyes wanted them to leave by any means possible, and the Master Chief obliges, punching his hand into the softened skull of the deceased captain, physically removing the chip from within. Black-armored Covenant special operatives arrive on the ship to thwart the Flood threat, and they are distraction enough for the Master Chief to hijack a Covenant <a href=\"/banshee/3055-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-374\">Banshee</a> and escape the Truth and Reconciliation.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\"><img alt=\"The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn</figcaption></figure><p>As the sun rises on Halo, the Master Chief\\'s Banshee reaches the Autumn, which has already been occupied by Flood and Sentinel forces since the Flood incursion. At the Autumn\\'s bridge, Cortana uses Keyes\\'s chip to activate the self-destruct sequence, but it is stopped by the Monitor, who has taken full control of the ship\\'s remaining functional systems. Although Cortana has finally run out of ideas, the Chief suggests they do it the old fashioned way: damage the fusion core using grenades or rockets, rendering it unstable to the point where detonation becomes inevitable.</p><p>The Master Chief fights through waves of Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels, all assaulting each other as well as the lone Spartan, who appears to be one of the only Humans left alive on Halo. After detonating the four reactors, the Chief successfully damages the fusion core and starts the inevitable chain reaction. Foe Hammer, having survived the Flood infection in her Pelican, tells the Master Chief to grab a Warthog from the vehicle depot and meet her at a landing pad just under a kilometer down the length of the ship, where she can extract him and Cortana and escape the destruction of Halo. Driving over Flood forms and dodging Sentinel laser cannons and Covenant plasma fire, the Chief makes it to the landing pad with minutes to spare, but Foe Hammer is ambushed by a pair of Covenant Banshees, and her Pelican crashes and explodes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\"><img alt=\"The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"The Maw\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"The Maw\"</figcaption></figure><p>With no time to mourn their most recently slain friend, the Master Chief and Cortana make one final charge: a Longsword starfighter is docked at the far end of the ship, and if they can make it there in time, they can use it to escape Halo. Seconds before the Autumn detonates, the Chief boards the Longsword and flees the ring, managing to get to a safe distance just before the nuclear reaction creates a shockwave whose power is enough to shatter Halo entirely, sending massive, concave shards careening through space. The Chief uses the Longsword\\'s sensors to search the debris field, hoping that other UNSC marines escaped the ring before its destruction. But there is nothing left but dust and echoes.</p><p>Cortana states that with Halo and the Covenant fleet destroyed, everything is finished, hinting at a sense of optimism.

At the time, Halo was going to be a simultaneous Mac and Windows release. Prior to MacWorld Halo had only been viewed behind closed doors by journalists who were required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. At this point Halo was intended to be a third-person-action game, in which a ship crash lands on a ring world and early versions of the <a href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">Covenant</a> aliens appear simply to loot what they can with the humans forced to resort to guerrilla warfare.</p><p>The first official trailer was shown at E3 2000 and was well received. One month later on June 19th 2000 Microsoft announced that it had acquired Bungie Studios; Halo had become an Xbox exclusive. Bungie rewrote the game\\'s engine and the game became a first person shooter. Playable demos carried mixed reactions up to its release simultaneously with the Xbox on November 15th, 2001.</p><h2>Post-release</h2><h3>Halo Custom Edition</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1140282\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.43983402489627\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1140282\"><img alt=\"Halo: Custom Edition\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png 241w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo: Custom Edition\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo: Custom Edition</figcaption></figure><p>Halo: Custom Edition is a free expansion that requires a key code from Halo: Combat Evolved to be played.

Under the new system, once <a href=\"/shield-regeneration/3015-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2349\">shields</a> have been depleted, the player can only take a few hits until death, but once shields recharge, health resets. This is explained through the new Mark VI suit, which injects bio-foam directly into the wearer\\'s wounds. <a href=\"/stealth-camouflage/3055-846/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">Active Camo</a> has been removed as an item. Instead, the Arbiter has a rechargeable version of Camo, instead of a <a href=\"/flashlight/3055-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlight</a> like the Chief. Another new addition is <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual wielding</a> certain weapons, including the <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol</a>, the new <a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">SMG</a>, the <a href=\"/needler/3055-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\">needler</a>, the <a href=\"/plasma-pistol/3055-119/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-119\">plasma pistol</a>, and the <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">plasma rifle</a>. When dual wielding, weapons take longer to reload and the ability to throw <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenades</a> is taken out. Another newly added mechanic is the ability to board enemy vehicles when they are near the player and travelling at low speeds.</p><p>The most noticeable change in the weapons is the absence of the iconic <a href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">assault rifle</a>. It is replaced by the new <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">battle rifle</a>; a three shot burst weapon with a 2x scope. The Covenant equivalent of the battle rifle is the <a href=\"/covenant-carbine/3055-137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-137\">carbine</a>; a semi-automatic weapon that also has a 2x scope (the carbine uses <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammo</a> instead of battery power). In addition to the battle rifle and carbine, there is now the SMG (a small compact fully automatic weapon), a new pistol with no scope, the <a href=\"/brute-shot/3055-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-123\">brute shot</a> (Covenant <a href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-252\">grenade launcher</a>), a <a href=\"/brute-plasma-rifle/3055-1105/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1105\">brute plasma rifle</a> (which fires faster than the regular plasma rifle), an improved <a href=\"/m41-rocket-launcher/3055-134/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-134\">rocket launcher</a> (which locks onto enemy vehicles), and the <a href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">energy sword</a> (which can now be used by the player).</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Compared to Halo: Combat Evolved, there have been some noticeable changes in the arsenals of both Human and Covenant forces. The <a href=\"/ma5b-assault-rifle/3055-5594/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5594\">MA5-series Assault Rifle</a> has been absent, replaced by both the <a href=\"/m7-smg/3055-126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-126\">M7 Submachine Gun</a> and <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">BR55 Battle Rifle</a>. The <a href=\"/m6d-pistol/3055-2806/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2806\">M6D Magnum</a> has also been replaced by the weaker M6C Magnum.

The game had many advanced features including <a href=\"/matchmaking/3015-3334/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3334\">matchmaking</a>, <a href=\"/voice-chat/3015-648/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-648\">voice chat</a>, and <a href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">rankings</a>. There was also some customization implemented into the game as well, which created a lot of <a href=\"/user-generated-content/3015-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-129\">user created content</a>. Many games came out of these customization options, such as Tremors, Troy, Vehicle Wars and the most popular being <a href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">Zombies</a> which grew so popular Bungie saw fit to put it into Halo 3. Players really enjoyed the customization options and kept many players sticking around even after getting their fill of matchmaking. The match making games were very competitive in Halo 2 due to the intensive ranking system. The way the ranking system in Halo 2 works is when the player first starts playing the game they start at level 1 and as they win matches their level increases. If they lose enough matches they can drop levels. These ranking were taken very seriously by the Halo 2 community. The color of the level a player had was very important to most Halo 2 fanatics. They can see what the levels look like in the picture below.</p><p>Levels 44-50 were \"secret\" levels -- they were picture of various things, such as the moon or the halo ring.</p><p>Halo 2 had 24 maps the people could play online and was the most played game ever on Xbox Live. Even after the Xbox 360 was released Halo 2 still remained the most popular. The first game to top the amount of online players Halo 2 had each month, was the original <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a>.</p><h3>Clans</h3><p>Halo 2 is one of the few Xbox games (and is the only game in the series) to support a dedicated in-game <a href=\"/clan/3015-643/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-643\">\"clan\"</a> system, where players can form named groups outside of the \"friends list\" system both to find games easier and to combat other Clans. Clans have a 100-member limit and must be invited by qualified Clan members.</p><p>There are four types of clanmates, each with their own hierarchy and privileges: <strong>Overlords</strong>, <strong>Staff</strong>, <strong>Members</strong>, and <strong>Peons</strong>. All clanmates can participate in Clan matches and can invite other players to join the Clan (with the exception of Peons). Overlords and Staff can promote/demote Members and Peons, as well as boot them from the clan. Overlords can do the same thing with Staff.</p><h3>Matchmaking Playlists</h3><ul><li>Rumble Pit</li><li>Double Team</li><li>Team Slayer</li><li>Team Skirmish</li><li>Team Training</li><li>Team Snipers</li><li>Team Hardcore</li><li>Big Team Battle</li><li>Team SWAT</li><li>H2 Challenge</li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-549346\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-549346\"><img alt=\"Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.</figcaption></figure><p>The Xbox version of Halo 2 included 12 multiplayer maps, two of which are remakes from <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>.

As players began to practice these glitches and become well-versed in executing them they gained a much more significant place in the <a href=\"/meta-game/3015-905/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-905\">meta-game</a>, with some of the weapon-based glitches becoming essential for success against the higher ranking players. While game creator Bungie officially decreed on several occasions that a player\\'s use of glitches for personal gain, in a Matchmaking setting, was a form of cheating, the developer had no way of tracking the use of such glitches by players. Ultimately, there were no widespread punishments or repercussions handed-down to players who utilized these glitches.</p><p>Some of the most noteworthy glitches:</p><h3><a href=\"/bxr/3015-2751/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2751\"><b>BXR</b></a></h3><p>Commonly used in conjunction with the <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">Battle Rifle</a> (though possible to execute with any reloadable weapon) the BXR was a weapon animation glitch that allowed for a nearly instantaneous close-ranged kill. The glitch became very widespread among the highest ranks of players as the meta-game progressed.</p><h3>Quick Reload (YY)</h3><p>Another glitch commonly used among higher-caliber players, the Quick Reload glitch was a weapon animation glitch that shaved precious seconds off of a player\\'s reload time, allowing them to fire their weapon again sooner than they normally would with the default reload. The glitch was only possible when a player was carrying a secondary weapon. The move was executed by the player pressing the Y button twice in quick succession as soon as the reload animation reached the point where the in-game character began to insert a new clip into the weapon. If done properly the player will quickly switch to their secondary weapon and then back to their primary, eliminating the rest of the reload animation while still giving the player a full clip.</p><h3>Double Melee (BXB)</h3><p>A third weapon animation glitch, the BXB was used to give players a significant advantage in close-range combat. Executed by pressing B, X, B in quick succession (under the default controller settings), the glitch allowed players to melee twice in a much shorter time span than if they were simply to press the melee button two times. Contrary to the BXR, which required a full clip of ammo to execute properly, the BXB required the player to have a partially depleted or empty ammo clip in their primary weapon. As with the other weapon glitches, the BXB saw very widespread use among the top-tier players.</p><h3>Double Shot (RRX)</h3><p>One of the most popular glitches among <a href=\"/major-league-gaming/3015-1858/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1858\">MLG</a> fans and players, the Double Shot was a glitch that was used primarily with the Battle Rifle that allowed players to fire two of the weapon\\'s 3-shot bursts in one shot, resulting in 6 bullets being fired at once. The downside to this glitch was that after successfully firing a Double Shot, there was a significant span of time (roughly two to three seconds) where the player could not fire their weapon, and could only attack if they threw a grenade, used a melee attack, or switched to a secondary weapon. For this reason players would often hold off on using a Double Shot unless they were one or several \"shots down\" in a BR fight, or had a secondary weapon that they could \"YY\" with to cancel the long delay after a successful double shot.</p><h3>Quad Shot (RRXYYRRX)</h3><p>Similar to the double shot the quad shot, if done right, can shoot 4 shots out of the BR in half the time it normally would take. To do this the player need two weapons, first they start out with their double shot then they press \"YY\" really fast in order to cancel the reload; if they double shot correctly they will notice the reload animation isn\\'t playing but it is still reloading in the background (this is normal so don\\'t worry), now after pressing \"YY\" do another double shot, and with much practice the player can do <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCEZz1zS3aQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"/super-bouncing/3015-401/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-401\">Super Bouncing</a> (also known as Super Jumping)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7421875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\"><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"></noscript></a><figcaption>A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.</figcaption></figure><p>A glitch in the game\\'s <a href=\"/havok-physics/3015-502/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok</a> physics engine that makes it possible for players to \"bounce\" to extreme heights, enabling them to reach previously inaccessible and out-of-bounds regions on a multiplayer map. The glitch was used quite frequently in a Matchmaking setting to give a player or team a significant advantage through an unreachable hiding spot or unfair vantage point.</p><h3>Sword Canceling (Butterflying)</h3><p>Sword canceling is a glitch that takes advantage of the \"lunge\" effect that the Energy Sword provides for the player. By aiming at an opponent with the Energy Sword at a close enough proximity for the reticule to light up red, then pressing the Right Trigger and X in quick succession, a player can achieve the normal Sword lunge without in any way damaging their opponent. The glitch is most commonly used to give players a means of reaching previously inaccessible ledges or areas of a map. The glitch earned the nickname \"Butterflying\" due to the strange, butterfly-like motion of the character model\\'s arms when performing the sword cancel.</p><h3>Rocket Sword Glitch</h3><p>A glitch that would require a sword and a rocket launcher as a secondary. The player would look at an enemy from a distance and rapidly alternate pressing \"Y\" and \"B\" and they would launch towards the person they were aiming at from afar.</p><h2>Cheating</h2><p>As with most online games, Halo 2\\'s online environment featured some players who manipulated and modified certain aspects of the game to provide themselves with an unfair advantage over their opponents. Players cheated most commonly in matchmaking playlists, so that they could more easily obtain a matchmaking rank that players would see associated with their gamertag. The highest-level matchmaking ranks, that featured symbols in place of numbers (ranks 44-50), were the most desirable and most sought after ranks to cheaters; therefore, non-cheaters often found it very difficult to play a legitimate, cheat-free match at the highest ranks. There were several different methods of cheating, each with different effects on gameplay.</p><h3>Modding</h3><p>Achieved through the use of cheat-devices such as Action Replay, Modding was the most common, game-changing form of cheating. \"Modders\" manipulated map files and gametypes to create gameplay that was well-outside the normal limits placed by the game engine. Common modded elements were changes in player speed and gravity, changed weapon properties (such as <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">Plasma Rifles</a> that fired <a href=\"/wraith/3055-531/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-531\">Wraith</a> projectiles), and changed vehicle properties (flying <a href=\"/m12-warthog/3055-193/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-193\">Warthogs</a>, flying turrets, faster <a href=\"/scorpion/3055-760/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-760\">Scorpions</a>, etc.). Due to the dramatic, game-changing effects of modding, it was fairly easy for Bungie\\'s automated banning tool -- notoriously dubbed the \"Banhammer\" by players and Bungie staff -- to detect and ban players who used modded files in matchmade games. Most \"modders\" had only a few hours, at most, to rise through the matchmaking ranks before being faced with a permanent ban, and a vast majority of modders were inevitably banned. The problem was that there were so many free two-month Xbox Live trials available, it was easy for a modder to quickly make another account.</p><h3>Standbying</h3><p>The second most game-changing form of cheating, behind Modding, was known as Standbying. Making use of the game\\'s host-based server system, standbying was achieved by having the \"host\" player manipulate their internet connection to cause problems for the other players in the match. When the host managed to successfully tamper with their connection, it would cause all of the other players in the game to experience enormous amounts of lag. The host\\'s Xbox was immune to the lag issues, and could travel around the map killing enemy players or completing game objectives without much, if any, opposition. Though the Standby glitch was originally achieved by players manually pressing the \"Standby\" button on their router, modem, or switch, eventually players used various computer software so that they could throttle the connections of only the opposing team, giving all of their teammates a reprieve from the negative effects of the glitch. Eventually, Bungie improved the banhammer to better detect and control \"standbyers\" in matchmaking.</p><h3>Bridging</h3><p>Bridging was a method of controlling \"host\" in a matchmaking game, and, more specifically, a way of ensuring that a certain player in the game always received host. Unlike modding and standbying, though, bridging was not a very detrimental form of cheating on its own. Bridging was accomplished through the use of specific Firewall software that controlled the ports and incoming IP Addresses for a player\\'s router or switch. By using the program with the correct settings, a player could be ensured of being host for every game they played. Also, due to the nature of the glitch, bridgers could not be matched with or against other bridgers, so the bridging player always decided who received host. While Bridging was used in conjunction with Standbying or Modding to ensure that those forms of cheating worked as efficiently as possible by giving a certain player host, it was also used as a preventative measure against cheaters. Some players used bridging to make sure that no nefarious players could obtain host, therefore ensuring a quality match experience. As of the 1.6 update for Halo 2, the most common methods of Bridging were no longer effective or possible in matchmaking.</p><h2><b>Soundtrack</b></h2><p>The Halo 2 Original Soundtrack was released in two volumes, composed by <a href=\"/martin-odonnell/3040-1741/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1741\">Martin O\\'Donnel</a> and <a href=\"/michael-salvatori/3040-1742/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1742\">Michael Salvatori</a>.
